download the file
unzip the file
search for text files using the find command

i've found that sometimes we need to search for long hexdecimal strings in file contents

grep -R -P '\b[0-9a-fA-F]{10,}\b' ./

we could adjust this kind of command to return base64 strings instead

grep -R -oP '\b[A-Za-z0-9+/]{12,}(={0,2}\b|==\b)' ./
