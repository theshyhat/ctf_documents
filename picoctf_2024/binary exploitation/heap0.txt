we can use the Write to Buffer function to overwrite the value of the safe_var (bico) to anything else, then use the Print Flag function.

Note the difference between the two memory addresses
There's 32 bytes between one and the other, so buffer overflow into the safe_var should occur at byte 33 of input

Overflow the safe_var variable using the Write to Buffer function with more than 33 characters of input

Use the print_flag function
